# arithmetic
General Description:
In the Zylab’s editor:

Write a program that includes statements to perform the following tasks in order:

Define two variables of type int and one of type double
Assign 8 to one of the integer variables
Get a whole number from the user and put it in the other integer variable. Be sure your prompt asks the user for a “whole number”
Calculate and display the sum of the two integers, storing the result in the double variable. Display the sum after the label “sum = “, advance to the next line after display.
Calculate and display the product of the two integers, storing the result in the double variable. Display the product after the label “product = “, advance to the next line after display.
Find and display the integer quotient produced when the user’s integer is divided by the other integer variable, storing the result in the double variable. Display the quotient after the label “quotient = “, advance to the next line after display.
Find and display the integer remainder produced when the user’s integer is divided by the other integer variable, storing the result in the double variable. Display the remainder after the label “remainder = “, advance to the next line after display.
Enter several values to test your program in Develop mode. Try numbers larger and smaller than 8. Try both positive and negative numbers. Do not forget you enter the values in the box labeled Enter program input (optional) and click Run my program to test.
